### The Battle of Neighborhoods - Curitiba: Using data science to find the best location for a new business
This rep contains the jupiter notebook and full report of the final capstone project of the Applied Data Science Capstone course from IBM, here's a quick introduction:
##### Background
Curitiba is one of the biggest and most multicultural cities of Brazil. It is regarded the best in which to invest in Brazil and because of its diverse economy and cultural background it is also considered a great place to launch new business ideas, services and even products. The city is divided into 9 boroughs covering the 75 neighborhoods, each with its own set of characteristics.
##### Problem
The same features that make Curitiba the great city that it is, also turn the task of choosing a location for a new business into a real challenge. The goal of this project is to figure out the best place to open a new special diets and healthy foods store, taking in consideration the owner’s preference for a region and the profile of the neighborhoods being analysed based on local venues and the local population’s demographics.
